# TerraLambda CLI Documentation

## Overview 
TerraLambda is a CLI tool designed to simplify the deployment and invocation of AWS Lambda functions using Terraform. It streamlines the function lifecycle by automating packaging, deployment, and execution processes, providing a seamless experience for developers working with AWS Lambda.
## Core concepts 
1. ### Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform
  TerraLambda leverages Terraform to define and manage AWS Lambda functions, ensuring a declarative and reproducible deployment process.
2.### AWS Lambda Deployment 
- The tool compiles the source code, packages it into a ZIP file, and deploys it using Terraform.
- Manages different versions of Lambda functions to support rollback mechanisms.
